Nanggong is a 63-key/60% handwired ortholinear keyboard built to fulfill my desire for an ortholinear layout while retaining important features such as arrow keys, numbers, and the standard 1.25u Ctrl key. This design caters to the needs of both programmers (with arrow keys) and gamers (featuring number keys and a 1.25u Ctrl size).

The keyboard is built using Arduino Pro Micro Atmega32u4 and QMK Firmware, and firmware has been created to support underglow and VIA Software.
