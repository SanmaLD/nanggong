Nanggong is a 63 keys/60% handwiring ortholinear keyboard made based on my desire to use an ortholinear keyboard but has common functions such as arrow keys, numbers, and normal 1.25u ctrl keys so that programmers and gamers can use this keyboard.

This keyboard is built using ProMicro and QMK Firmware that has been programmed to support underglow and VIA Software.

Material
63x: Cherry compatible switches.
63x: Diodos (1N4148).
